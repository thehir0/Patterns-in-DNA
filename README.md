## Analysis of Randomness
To investigate the potential presence of structure in the DNA data, the distribution of
palindromes across the DNA was analyzed for deviations from a uniform scatter. Five
random uniformly distributed sequences were generated and plotted alongside the DNA
sequence. The comparison between the distribution of palindromes in the DNA sequence
and that of the random uniform distribution did not reveal any significant differences. To
provide a more formal statistical assessment of the randomness of the distribution, a
chi-squared test was performed with the null hypothesis being that the palindromes are
uniformly scattered across the DNA sequence and the alternative hypothesis being that they
are not. The level of significance was set to 0.05, and the test rejected the null hypothesis of
uniform random scatter.

## Analysis of Palindrome Locations and Spacings
The spacing between consecutive palindromes and sums of consecutive pairs, triplets, and
so on were calculated for the CMV DNA sequence. The purpose of this analysis was to
compare the observed results with what would be expected in a random scatter. No
significant differences were observed.

## Analysis of Palindrome Counts
The DNA sequence was divided into non-overlapping regions of equal length to compare the
observed counts of palindromes with the expected count from uniform random scatter. A
significant cluster was observed in the interval ranging between 90000 and 93750, indicating
that palindromes are concentrated in this range. This finding suggests that it may be a
potential origin of replication, and it is recommended to begin evaluating the origin of
replication from this interval.
